# Lazy Lambda â€” a Flappy Bird clone in Haskell with SpriteKit

![Lazy Lambda Loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchakravarty/lazy-lambda/master/images/LazyLambdaLoop.gif)

Lazy Lambda is a clone of Flappy Bird in Haskell based on the [Haskell SpriteKit binding](https://github.com/mchakravarty/HaskellSpriteKit). Check out the video and slides of my [Compose :: Melbourne 2016](http://www.composeconference.org/2016-melbourne/day-one-program/) keynote, where I outline the concepts behind the SpriteKit binding and live code Lazy Lambda:

For the best Haskell SpriteKit development experience, check out [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com). The Lazy Lambda code in this repository already comes in the form of a Haskell for Mac project.
